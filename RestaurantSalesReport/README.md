# Restaurant Sales Report

This project demonstrates managing and displaying daily sales for multiple restaurants using **Jagged Arrays** in C#.

## Features
- **Jagged Array**: Stores daily sales for each restaurant, allowing different number of entries per restaurant.
- Calculates **total**, **minimum**, and **maximum** sales for each restaurant.
- Displays sales data in a clean, formatted table in the console.
- Handles restaurants with no sales safely.
- Demonstrates modular code using methods like `DisplayRestaurantSales` and `PrintSalesSummary`.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Run the program.
3. Observe the console output showing each restaurantâ€™s sales, totals, and min/max values.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand **Jagged Arrays** for non-uniform data.
- Practice safe iteration and data aggregation.
- Learn to structure console output in a readable and professional format.
- Modular programming with separate methods for display and calculations.
