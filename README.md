## 🔹 Projects

### 1. [BinaryTreeExample](https://github.com/SilentDev-Na/Data-Structure-Examples/tree/main/BinaryTreeExample)
An example project demonstrating **Binary Tree operations**, including insertion, traversal, and searching.

### 2. [Custom-ICollection](https://github.com/SilentDev-Na/Data-Structure-Examples/tree/main/Custom-ICollection)
Implementation of a **custom collection** that mimics `ICollection` behavior with basic add, remove, and enumeration functionalities.

### 3. [Implementing Graph Using Adjacency Matrix](https://github.com/SilentDev-Na/Data-Structure-Examples/tree/main/Implementing%20Graph%20Using%20Adjacency%20Matrix)
Demonstrates a **Graph data structure** using an **Adjacency Matrix**, supporting both **Directed** and **Undirected** graphs, with edge operations and change tracking.

### 4. [JaggedArrayStudentGrades](https://github.com/SilentDev-Na/Data-Structure-Examples/tree/main/JaggedArrayStudentGrades)
Example of using **jagged arrays** to store and process **student grades**, with dynamic row sizes for each student.

### 5. [RestaurantSalesReport](https://github.com/SilentDev-Na/Data-Structure-Examples/tree/main/RestaurantSalesReport)
Demonstrates **reporting and aggregation** using arrays and collections to calculate restaurant sales statistics.
