# 🌳 Binary Tree Visualization in C#

This project demonstrates a simple **Binary Tree implementation** in C#, where you can insert nodes and print the tree structure in a visual (sideways) format using recursive traversal.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project consists of three main files:

1. **`BinaryTreeNode<T>`**  
   Represents a single node in the binary tree.  
   Each node stores:
   - A `Value` (generic type `T`)
   - References to the `Left` and `Right` child nodes

2. **`BinaryTree<T>`**  
   Manages the tree operations such as:
   - Inserting new nodes (level-order insertion)
   - Printing the tree structure visually in the console

3. **`Program.cs`**  
   The entry point that demonstrates the tree by inserting sample values and displaying the result.

## ⚙️ Features

- Generic binary tree that supports any data type (`int`, `string`, etc.)
- Automatic level-order insertion
- Recursive tree visualization (prints right-to-left orientation)
- Simple and clean console output

## 🧰 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any **C# IDE**.
3. Run the project (press **F5**).
4. The console will display the inserted values and the tree visualization.
